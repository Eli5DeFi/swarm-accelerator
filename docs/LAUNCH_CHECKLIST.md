### X Launch Thread

🚀 THREAD: I built an AI swarm that does VC due diligence in 4 seconds

After analyzing how VCs evaluate startups, I created 4 specialized AI agents that run in parallel

Here's what happened when I let founders pitch to the swarm instead of humans...

🧵👇

[2/15] The Problem:

VCs take 4-6 WEEKS to make funding decisions

Founders waste months pitching to hundreds of investors

Only 1-2% of pitches get funded

There had to be a better way...

[3/15] The Solution:

I built an AI "swarm" - 4 agents that analyze:
• Financial viability
• Technical feasibility  
• Market opportunity
• Legal compliance

All in PARALLEL. Total time: 4-8 seconds.
