- Maybe get accepted

**VentureClaw:**
- Submit application (5 minutes)
- AI swarm analyzes (30 seconds)
- Get detailed feedback report (instant)
- **Invited to pitch to sharks** (if qualified)

**Key Difference:** No waiting, instant feedback, AI evaluates 100% of applications

---

### Phase 2: SharkTank Pitch (Week 1)

**Key Difference:** Entertainment value, competitive offers, public participation

---

### Phase 3: Batch Program (3 Months)

**Traditional YC:**
- Weekly dinner talks (group)
